  abstract = {For common condensed phase problems described by a low-dimensional system coupled to a harmonic bath, Feynman's path integral formulation of time-dependent quantum mechanics leads to expressions for the reduced density matrix of the system where the effects of the harmonic environment enter through an influence functional that is nonlocal in time. In a recent Letter [Chem. Phys. Lett. 221, 482 (1994)], we demonstrated that the range of the nonlocal interactions is finite even at zero temperature, such that the nonlocal kernel extends over only a few time steps if the path integral is expressed in terms of accurate quasiadiabatic propagators. This feature arises from disruption of phase coherence in macroscopic environments and leads to Markovian dynamics for an augmented reduced density tensor, permitting iterative time evolution schemes. In the present paper we analyze the structure and properties of the relevant tensor propagator. Specifically, we show that the tensor multiplication scheme rigorously conserves the trace of the reduced density matrix, and that in cases of short-range nonlocality it leads to Redfield-type equations which are correct to all orders in perturbation theory and which take into account memory effects. We also argue that a simple eigenvector analysis reveals (without actual iteration) the nature of the dynamics and of the equilibrium state, and directly yields quantum reaction or relaxation rates.},

  abstract = {In a recent Letter [Chem. Phys. Lett. 221, 482 (1994)], we demonstrated that the dynamics of reduced density matrices for systems in contact with dissipative harmonic environments can be obtained in an iterative fashion by multiplication of a propagator tensor. The feasibility of iterative procedures in reduced dimension spaces arises from intrinsic features of the dissipative influence functional in Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum dynamics. Specifically, the continuum of frequencies characteristic of broad condensed phase spectra disrupts phase coherence to a large extent, such that the dynamics of an augmented reduced density tensor becomes Markovian. In a preceding article [J. Chem. Phys. 102, 4600 (1995)] we examined in detail the formal properties of the tensor propagator. In the present paper we show that the tensor propagator can be further decomposed into a product of small rank tensors, resulting in an extremely simple and efficient numerical scheme that scales almost linearly with the dimension of the augmented reduced density tensor. Numerical application to a model electron transfer reaction is presented.},

  abstract = {The real-time path integral representation of the reduced density matrix for a discrete system in contact with a dissipative medium is rewritten in terms of the number of blips, i.e., elementary time intervals over which the forward and backward paths are not identical. For a given set of blips, it is shown that the path sum with respect to the coordinates of all remaining time points is isomorphic to that for the wavefunction of a system subject to an external driving term and thus can be summed by an inexpensive iterative procedure. This exact decomposition reduces the number of terms by a factor that increases exponentially with propagation time. Further, under conditions (moderately high temperature and/or dissipation strength) that lead primarily to incoherent dynamics, the ``fully incoherent limit'' zero-blip term of the series provides a reasonable approximation to the dynamics, and the blip series converges rapidly to the exact result. Retention of only the blips required for satisfactory convergence leads to speedup of full-memory path integral calculations by many orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {The recently introduced multisite tensor network path integral (MS-TNPI) allows simulation of extended quantum systems coupled to dissipative media. We use MS-TNPI to simulate the exciton transport and the absorption spectrum of a B850 bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) ring. The MS-TNPI network is extended to account for the ring topology of the B850 system. Accurate molecular-dynamics-based description of the molecular vibrations and the protein scaffold is incorporated through the framework of Feynman\textendash Vernon influence functional. To relate the present work with the excitonic picture, an exploration of the absorption spectrum is done by simulating it using approximate and topologically consistent transition dipole moment vectors. Comparison of these numerically exact MS-TNPI absorption spectra are shown with second-order cumulant approximations. The effect of temperature on both the exact and the approximate spectra is also explored.},

  abstract = {Tensors with finite correlation afford very compact tensor network representations. A novel tensor network-based decomposition of real-time path integral simulations involving Feynman-Vernon influence functional is introduced. In this tensor network path integral (TNPI) technique, the finitetemporarily non-local interactions introduced by the influence functional can be captured very effi-ciently using matrix product state representation for the path-dependent Green's function (PDGF). We illustrate this particular TNPI method through various realistic examples, including a chargetransfer reaction and an exciton transfer in a dimer. We also show how it is readily applied to systems with greater than two states. PDGF-TNPI utilizes the symmetries of the problem, leading to accelerated convergence and dramatic reductions of computational effort. We also introduce anapproximate method that speeds up propagation beyond the non-local memory length. Further-more, the structure imposed by the tensor network representation of the PDGF naturally suggests other factorizations that make simulations for extended systems more efficient. These factorizations would be the subject of future explorations. The flexibility of the PDGF-TNPI framework makesit a promising new addition to the family of path integral methods for non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.},

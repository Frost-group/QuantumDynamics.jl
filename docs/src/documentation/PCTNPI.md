# Pairwise-Connected Tensor Network Path Integral

It has been shown in [PC-TNPI](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.105.024309) that a general tensor network can be formulated that manifestly captures the symmetries present in the path integral expression. It can be used by itself or as a starting point for deriving other tensor network decompositions of path integrals.
